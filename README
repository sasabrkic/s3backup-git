# Description

This is a Bash shell script that is mainly intended for backing up Mercurial repositories from a Mercurial server to an Amazon S3 bucket.

Currently, the script only works on Red Hat based distributions.

The script executes following:

1. Stops the Apache server
2. Copies repositories to a working directory
3. Starts the Apache server
4. Packages (tar.gz) repositories to a date stamped archive
5. Uploads the archive to an Amazon S3 bucket

You need to have s3cmd installed and configured on your system.
